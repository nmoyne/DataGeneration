**  2020-06-09  **
- MUST is online

**  2020-06-10  **
- MUSTstat: Another IP website has been added  (minor)
- this file "updates.txt" has been added

** 2020-06-11 **
- TXDELAY: the "plane wave" option for a convex array has been added  (potentially useful)
- IMPOLGRID: The 1st z-values of the grid have been modified  (minor)

** 2020-06-12 **
- PFIELD: The persistent variable pfieldToday was removed  (minor)
- PFIELD: RPmono = sum(DIR.*EXP,3) => RPmono = sum(DIR.*EXP,3)/M  (not very important)
- SIMUS: license('checkout','Distrib_Computing_Toolbox') => license('test','Distrib_Computing_Toolbox')  (may avoid an annoying warning message)
- PFIELD, SIMUS, MKMOVIE: BSC has been replaced by RC everywhere. The term "backscattering coefficient" was physically incorrect. It has been replaced by "reflection coefficient"  (minor)

** 2020-06-22 **
- SIMUS: A conflict existed between ParPool and AdMessage (fixed)
- PFIELD: isNEAR has been modified (not very important)
- SPTRACK and BMODE are now part of the MUST toolbox

** 2020-06-24 **
- IQ2DOPPLER: a scalar M returned [M 1] in the code (instead of [M M]). Fixed.

** 2020-08-02 **
- PFIELD: The pressure field is now proportional to ElementWidth to be consistent with the theory. This is a multiplicative factor (not very important).

** 2020-09-02 **
- DASMTX: an error appeared when the delay vector contained a single finite element. Fixed.

** 2020-09-19 **
- GETPARAM: now returns structures with fields "focus" and "height
- PFIELD: isNEAR has been modified, isOUT has been added (not very important)
- PFIELD: numerical instabilities are better controlled

** 2020-09-19 **

- GETPULSE has been added in the MUST toolbox.

** 2021-01-05 **
MAJOR UPDATES on PFIELD and SIMUS (MUST version #2)
- An elevation focusing can now be included (3-D acoustic wave equations).
- PARAM.TXdelay no longer available for PFIELD and SIMUS.
- There was a bug in the two-way pulse. I don't know why... Fixed.
- The variable isNEAR no longer exists in the code.
- The PFIELD code has been significantly modified. The theory has been double-checked while writing the theoretical paper that was submitted in 2021.

** 2021-01-09 **
- PFIELD: The max(X,[],'all') have been replaced by max(X(:))

** 2021-01-14 **
- SIMUS: The very small RF values are zeroed (with a smooth transition)

** 2021-01-15 **
- PFIELD: Some coefficients of the multi-Gaussian beam model were wrong! The default case (n=3) was OK.
- n = 6 (from Wen1988) has been removed (it was incorrect!)
- n = 5 has been fixed (it was incorrect!)
- n = 1,2,3,4 have been fine-tuned (not important)
- The default is now n = 4

** 2021-01-29 **
- SPTRACK: The max(X,[],'all') have been replaced by max(X(:))
- idem with any(X,'all')

** 2021-08-12 **
- LVscat.mat: BSC has been replaced by RC (error in the variable name)

** 2021-09-10 **
- PFIELD: There was an error when param.TXnow = Inf: the line { if isinf(T), T = 1e6; end } has been added (line 716)
- SIMUS: maxD was infinite if param.TXnow = Inf. Fixed

** 2021-09-14 **
- DASMTX: A minor error occured when the field TXdelay of PARAM was not properly written. 'TXdelay' has been added in the fieldLIST cell in the function IgnoreCaseInFieldNames.

** 2022-03-30 **
- IMPOLGRID: For a linear array, the z-coordinate of the Origo is now 0 (for information, the old value is in comment). This choice is "more compatible" with focused strategies used in echocardiography.

** 2022-03-31 **
- LVscat.mat: The variable BSC has been renamed RC.

** 2022-04-07 **
- PFIELD: I removed the lines: IDX = cumsum(IDX,'reverse') & cumsum(IDX); f = f(IDX);
And replaced them by:
f = f(find(IDX,1):find(IDX,1,'last'));

** 2022-04-14 **
- PFIELD: I made another mistake! Here is the correct syntax:
IDX = IDX(find(IDX,1):find(IDX,1,'last'));
f = f(IDX);
Note (see ** 2023-04-27 **): I was wrong!...

** 2022-05-03 **
- GENSCAT: I replaced: raylrnd(1,1,length(xs))'
by: hypot(rand(length(xs),1),rand(length(xs),1))
since the raylrnd function needs the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

** 2022-05-06 **
- DASMTX: An error occurred when the delays were in single precision. Fixed.

** 2022-05-10 **
- GENSCAT: I added a random reordering of the xs, ys, zs.

** 2022-05-14 **
- SIMUS: I replaced "nf = param.fs/2/param.fc*(Nf-1);" by "nf = ceil(param.fs/2/param.fc*(Nf-1));".
Thank you Thurston B!

** 2022-10-07 **
- TXDELAY: The tilt angles were not defined in the trigonometric direction. Thank you Jorgen (Avdal)! I fixed this major issue and updated the examples of the website and user guide.

** 2022-10-18 **
- PFIELD: I added some input tests for PARAM.kerf, PARAM.width, and PARAM.pitch. Not important.

** 2022-10-20 **
- TXDELAY: Some minor modifications in the test and help texts. Not important.

** 2022-10-30 **
- SIMUS and PFIELD: Some minor modifications in the test and help texts. Not important.

** 2022-11-13 **
- PFIELD: The SPECT output parameter was incorrectly arranged. Fixed by SPECT = reshape(SPECT.',[siz0 nSampling]);

** 2022-12-06 **
- GETPARAM: two Vermon matrix arrays have been added in the list.
Thank you François V!

** 2022-12-06 **
New functions are available (for simulation of planar matrix arrays). Not yet online (only @CREATIS)
- TXDELAY3
- PFIELD3
- SIMUS3
- DASMTX3 (by François Varray, from DASMTX)

** 2022-12-19 **
- SIMUS: I modified the maximal distance (maxD); I added the length of the pulse.

** 2023-01-08 **
MAJOR UPDATES (MUST version #3)
- MUST includes six new functions, including five for 3-D ultrasound imaging:
DAS3, DASMTX3, PFIELD3, SIMUS3, TXDELAY3
- It also includes VIEWXDCR to view your transducer

** 2023-01-09 **
- PFIELD3: Large 1/r values occurred in the very near field. Fixed.
- PFIELD : Such problems were already considered in PFIELD. However, I slightly modified the small r values to make it consistent with PFIELD3.

** 2023-01-20 **
- VIEWXDCR: I added a syntax: VIEWXDCR(PARAM,UNIT).
- GENSCAT: I replaced: raylrnd(1,1,length(xs))'
by: hypot(rand(length(xs),1),rand(length(xs),1))
since the raylrnd function needs the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
(there was another one that I missed, see 2022-05-03)

** 2023-03-01 **
- DAS and DAS3: data are chunked to avoid tall DAS matrices.

** 2023-04-20 **
- RF2IQ: there was a mistake when estimating the carrier frequency

** 2023-04-24 **
PFIELD, PFIELD3, GETPULSE:
The frequencies are now shifted such that the center frequency for a pulse-echo is exactly PARAM.fc
(now removed, see ** 2023-11-08 **)

** 2023-04-27 **
- PFIELD and PFIELD3:
IDX = IDX(find(IDX,1):find(IDX,1,'last')); was not correct (see ** 2022-04-07 **).
I replaced it by:
IDX(find(IDX,1):find(IDX,1,'last')) = true;
Thank you Gabriel Bernardino!

** 2023-05-12 **
-WFILT:
I added error messages in case the degree N is too large.

** 2023-06-12 **
- BMODE
I added the following syntax: bmode(IQ,Gamma)

** 2023-07-07 **
I've changed my mind
- IMPOLGRID: I've changed my mind (see ** 2022-03-30 **).  Back to the previous version (line 120).

** 2023-10-20 **
- PFIELD: MUSTstat becomes MUSTstat(p), with p = fileparts(mfilename('fullpath'));
- MUSTstat: MUSTstat.mat is now created in the MUST toolbox folder.

** 2023-11-08 **
I removed the modifications done in 2023-04-24
- PFIELD, PFIELD3, GETPULSE:
The frequencies are NO LONGER shifted. It was not a good idea when compounding data...
Thank you François Varray!

** 2023-12-11 **
- DAS and DASMTX:
An option has been added: you can enter the location of the virtual source as an input parameter.
This syntax is recommended for focused waves (it was not correct before...) 
# Note: this option no longer exists (2024)

** 2024-01-18 **
- PFIELD and PFIELD3:
The function "checkUpdate" checks whether the MUST toolbox is not out-of-date.
- CITE:
The paper "Think twice before f-numbering" has been added

** 2024-02-07 **
- DASMTX:
Hidden syntax: if PARAM.mean is true, weights have been added to consider the length of the apertures (with an f-number). They are equal to 1/subaperture_length:
W = nc./sum(Iaperture,2);
W(~isfinite(W)) = 1;

** 2024-05-28 **
- TXDELAY:
Diverging (circular) waves are now possible with convex arrays

** 2024-06-17 **
- DASMTX:
Major Modifications!
The transmit distances are now calculated by estimating a virtual transducer. They are equal to the smallest distances between the virtual transducer and the scatterers (= lengths of the segments perpendicular to the virtual transducer).

** 2024-06-26 **
- DASMTX3:
Major Modifications!
The transmit distances are now calculated by estimating a virtual transducer. They are equal to the smallest distances between the virtual transducer and the scatterers (= lengths of the segments perpendicular to the virtual transducer).

** 2024-07-03 **
- DASMTX and VXDCR:
The test for convexity/concavity has been corrected. The lambda are now in ]0,1[.

** 2025-01-09 **
- SIMUS and SIMUS3:
When param.TXnow = Inf, there was an issue in:
    [~,tp] = getpulse(param,2); % two-way pulse
    maxD = maxD + tp(end)*param.c; % add the pulse length
I added the condition: if isfinite(param.TXnow)
Thank you Deep Bera!
- GETPULSE
Same problem. GETPULSE now returns NaN if param.TXnow = Inf.
- CITE:
The paper "SIMUS3" has been added in the list.

** 2025-01-20 **
- TXDELAY3
The lines
    x1 = repmat([x0(1);y0(1);z0(1)],1,size(x0,2));
    x2 = repmat([x0(2);y0(2);z0(2)],1,size(x0,2));
were useless as size(x0,2) was always 1.
Replaced by
    x1 = [x0(1);y0(1);z0(1)];
    x2 = [x0(2);y0(2);z0(2)];
Thank you David Ribalta!

** 2025-01-21 **
- DASMTX3
There was a MAJOR issue spotted by F. Varray.
I made a mistake in the distances from a point to the lines normal to the virtual transducer.

** 2025-01-22 **
- DASMTX3
The variable nt = size(tri,1) was missing...
